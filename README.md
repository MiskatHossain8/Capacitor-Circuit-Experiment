# Capacitor-Circuit-Experiment
This Capacitor Circuit Experiment project, developed for CSE209: Electrical Circuits at East West University, focused on hands-on analysis of capacitor-based circuits and practical circuit operation. Theoretical results were validated using PSpice, showing no discrepancies.

## 📌 Project Overview

The main objectives of this project are:

- Focused on capacitor-based circuit design and analysis.
- Learned practical circuit construction and measurement techniques.
- Performed theoretical calculations and verified results using PSpice simulation.
- Observed no significant discrepancy between theoretical and simulated values.
- Gained understanding of capacitor behavior in electrical circuits.

This project provides hands-on experience in analyzing capacitor circuits through practical and theoretical experiments, with verification using PSpice.

## 🧠 Concepts Used

- Performed theoretical measurements of current (I), voltage (V), and resistance (R).
- Developed and simulated the circuit in PSpice, verifying results against theoretical calculations with no discrepancies.
- Conducted practical experiments on a breadboard using resistors, capacitors, and a LED to observe real-world behavior.
- Observed that in an open circuit, capacitors fully charge, allowing the light to stay on temporarily.
