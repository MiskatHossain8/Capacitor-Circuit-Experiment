# Capacitor-Circuit-Experiment
This Capacitor Circuit Experiment project, developed for CSE209: Electrical Circuits at East West University, focused on hands-on analysis of capacitor-based circuits and practical circuit operation. Theoretical results were validated using PSpice, showing no discrepancies.
